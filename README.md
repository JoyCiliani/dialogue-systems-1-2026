This repo contains the code for the exercises from Laboratory 3.

**Task 1 and 2:** I started by setting up the development environment, creating an Azure account, and enabling voice services. Then I ran the sample project and created the appointment process flow. 

**Task 3:** The task 3 can be found in the file: report-lab3.pdf
